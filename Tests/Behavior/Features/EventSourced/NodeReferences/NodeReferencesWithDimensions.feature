Feature: Node References with Dimensions

  References between nodes are created are available in specializations but not in generalizations or peer variants.

#  @todo implement scenario that verifies references not available in generalisations of the source they are created in
#  @todo implement scenario that verifies references are copied when a node specialisation is created
#  @todo implement scenario that verifies references can be overwritten in node specialisation without affecting the generalization

  Background:
    Given I have the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Default | Values          | Generalizations      |
      | language   | mul     | mul, de, en, ch | ch->de->mul, en->mul |
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:NodeWithReferences':
      properties:
        referenceProperty:
          type: reference
        referencesProperty:
          type: references
    """
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:

  Scenario: Create a reference and check whether they can be read in the different subgraphs
    When the command SetNodeReferences is executed with payload:
      | Key                                 | Value                 |
      | contentStreamIdentifier             | "cs-identifier"       |
      | sourceNodeAggregateIdentifier       | "source-nodandaise"   |
      | sourceOriginDimensionSpacePoint     | {"language": "de"}    |
      | referenceName                       | "referenceProperty"   |
      | destinationNodeAggregateIdentifiers | ["anthony-destinode"] |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date

    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and Dimension Space Point {"language": "de"}
    Then I expect the node aggregate "source-nodandaise" to have the references:
      | Key               | Value                 |
      | referenceProperty | ["anthony-destinode"] |
    And I expect the node aggregate "anthony-destinode" to be referenced by:
      | Key               | Value                 |
      | referenceProperty | ["source-nodandaise"] |

    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and Dimension Space Point {"language": "ch"}
    Then I expect the node aggregate "source-nodandaise" to have the references:
      | Key               | Value                 |
      | referenceProperty | ["anthony-destinode"] |
    And I expect the node aggregate "anthony-destinode" to be referenced by:
      | Key               | Value                 |
      | referenceProperty | ["source-nodandaise"] |

    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and Dimension Space Point {"language": "en"}
    Then I expect the node aggregate "source-nodandaise" to have the references:
      | Key               | Value |
      | referenceProperty | []    |
    And I expect the node aggregate "anthony-destinode" to be referenced by:
      | Key               | Value |
      | referenceProperty | []    |
