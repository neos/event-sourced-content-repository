Feature: Create node variant

  As a user of the CR I want to create a copy of a node within an aggregate to another dimension space point.

  Background:
    Given I have the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Default | Values  | Generalizations |
      | market     | DE      | DE, CH  | CH->DE          |
      | language   | de      | de, gsw | gsw->de         |
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document':
      childNodes:
        tethered:
          type: 'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Tethered'
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Tethered': []
    """
