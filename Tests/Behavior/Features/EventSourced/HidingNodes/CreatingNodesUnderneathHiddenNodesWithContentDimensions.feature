Feature: Creation of nodes underneath hidden nodes WITH content dimensions

  If we create new nodes belonging to an aggregate, underneath of hidden nodes, they must be marked as "hidden" as well; i.e. they
  must have the proper restriction edges as well.

  Node structure created in BG:
  - rn-identifier (root node)
  -- na-identifier (name=text1) [de, en] <== HIDDEN!
  --- cna-identifier (name=text2) [de]

  Background:
    Given I have the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Default | Values  | Generalizations |
      | language   | de      | de, gsw | gsw->de         |
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    Neos.ContentRepository:Root: {}
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Content':
      properties:
        text:
          type: string
    """
