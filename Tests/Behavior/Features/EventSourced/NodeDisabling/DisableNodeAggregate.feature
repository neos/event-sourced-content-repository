Feature: Disable a node

  As a user of the CR I want to disable a node aggregate and expect its descendants to also be disabled.

  These are the base test cases for the NodeAggregateCommandHandler to block invalid commands.

  # @todo catch disabling of node aggregates in a non-covered dimension space point in the multidimensional case

  Background:
    Given I have no content dimensions
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': []
    """
    And the event RootWorkspaceWasCreated was published with payload:
      | Key                            | Value                                  |
      | workspaceName                  | "live"                                 |

      | currentContentStreamIdentifier | "cs-identifier"                        |
    And the event RootNodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated was published with payload:

  Scenario: Try to disable a node aggregate in a non-existing content stream
    When the command DisableNodeAggregate is executed with payload and exceptions are caught:
      | Key                            | Value                    |

      | nodeAggregateDisablingStrategy | "allVariants"            |
    Then the last command should have thrown an exception of type "ContentStreamDoesNotExistYet"

  Scenario: Try to disable a node aggregate in a non-existing dimension space point
    When the command DisableNodeAggregate is executed with payload and exceptions are caught:
      | Key                            | Value                       |

  Scenario: Try to disable a non-existing node aggregate
    When the command DisableNodeAggregate is executed with payload and exceptions are caught:

    Then the last command should have thrown an exception of type "NodeAggregateCurrentlyDoesNotExist"

  Scenario: Try to disable an already disabled node aggregate
    Given the event NodeAggregateWasDisabled was published with payload:
