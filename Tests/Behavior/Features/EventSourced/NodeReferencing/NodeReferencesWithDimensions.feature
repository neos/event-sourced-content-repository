Feature: Node References with Dimensions

  References between nodes are created are available in specializations but not in generalizations or peer variants.

  Background:
    Given I have the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Default | Values          | Generalizations      |
      | language   | mul     | mul, de, en, ch | ch->de->mul, en->mul |
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:NodeWithReferences':
      properties:
        referenceProperty:
          type: reference
        referencesProperty:
          type: references
