Feature: Change Property Value across dimensions; and test DimensionSpacePoints filter

  NOTE: ChangePropertyValue is tested exhaustively in ChangePropertyValues_NoDimensions.feature; here,
  we focus more on dimension selection (using the new DimensionSpace Filter)

  Background:
    Given I have the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Default | Values          | Generalizations      |
      | language   | mul     | mul, de, en, ch | ch->de->mul, en->mul |

    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root':
      constraints:
        nodeTypes:
          'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': true
