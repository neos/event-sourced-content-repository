Feature: Move a node without content dimensions

  As a user of the CR I want to move a node
  - to the end of its siblings
  - before one of its siblings
  - to a new parent and the end of its children
  - to a new parent and before one of its children

  These are the test cases for moving nodes without content dimensions being involved

  Background:
    Given I have no content dimensions
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': []
    """

    When the graph projection is fully up to date
    Then I expect the graph projection to consist of exactly 4 nodes
    And I expect a node with identifier {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"lady-eleonode-rootford", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}} to exist in the content graph
    And I expect a node with identifier {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"sir-david-nodenborough", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}} to exist in the content graph
    And I expect a node with identifier {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"nody-mc-nodeface", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}} to exist in the content graph
    And I expect a node with identifier {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"sir-nodeward-nodington-iii", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}} to exist in the content graph

    # node aggregate occupation and coverage is not relevant without dimensions and thus not tested

    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and Dimension Space Point {}
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-david-nodenborough" and path "document" to lead to node {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"sir-david-nodenborough", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}}
    And I expect this node to be a child of node {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"lady-eleonode-rootford", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}}
    And I expect this node to have the preceding siblings []
    And I expect this node to have the succeeding siblings ["nody-mc-nodeface", "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii"]
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "nody-mc-nodeface" and path "child-document" to lead to node {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"nody-mc-nodeface", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}}
    And I expect this node to be a child of node {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"lady-eleonode-rootford", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}}
    And I expect this node to have the preceding siblings ["sir-david-nodenborough"]
    And I expect this node to have the succeeding siblings ["sir-nodeward-nodington-iii"]
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii" and path "esquire" to lead to node {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"sir-nodeward-nodington-iii", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}}
    And I expect this node to be a child of node {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"lady-eleonode-rootford", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}}
    And I expect this node to have the preceding siblings ["nody-mc-nodeface", "sir-david-nodenborough"]
