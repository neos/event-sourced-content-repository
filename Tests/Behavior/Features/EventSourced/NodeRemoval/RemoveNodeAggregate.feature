Feature: Remove NodeAggregate

  As a user of the CR I want to be able to remove a NodeAggregate or parts of it.

  These are the base test cases for the NodeAggregateCommandHandler to block invalid commands.

  # @todo catch removal of node aggregates in a non-covered dimension space point in the multidimensional case

  Background:
    Given I have no content dimensions
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Inner': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document':
      childNodes:
        foo:
          type: 'Neos.ContentRepository:Inner'
    """
    And the event RootWorkspaceWasCreated was published with payload:

  Scenario: Try to remove a node aggregate in a non-existing content stream
    When the command RemoveNodeAggregate is executed with payload and exceptions are caught:
      | Key                          | Value                    |
      | contentStreamIdentifier      | "i-do-not-exist"         |

      | nodeVariantSelectionStrategy | "allVariants"            |
    Then the last command should have thrown an exception of type "ContentStreamDoesNotExistYet"

  Scenario: Try to remove a node aggregate in a non-existing dimension space point
    When the command RemoveNodeAggregate is executed with payload and exceptions are caught:
      | Key                          | Value                       |
      | contentStreamIdentifier      | "cs-identifier"             |
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier      | "sir-david-nodenborough"    |
      | coveredDimensionSpacePoint   | {"undeclared": "undefined"} |
      | nodeVariantSelectionStrategy | "allVariants"               |
    Then the last command should have thrown an exception of type "DimensionSpacePointNotFound"

  Scenario: Try to remove a non-existing node aggregate
    When the command RemoveNodeAggregate is executed with payload and exceptions are caught:
      | Key                          | Value            |
      | contentStreamIdentifier      | "cs-identifier"  |
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier      | "i-do-not-exist" |
      | coveredDimensionSpacePoint   | {}               |
      | nodeVariantSelectionStrategy | "allVariants"    |
    Then the last command should have thrown an exception of type "NodeAggregateCurrentlyDoesNotExist"

  Scenario: Remove node works
    Then I expect the graph projection to consist of exactly 3 nodes
    When the command RemoveNodeAggregate is executed with payload:
      | Key                          | Value                    |
      | contentStreamIdentifier      | "cs-identifier"          |

      | coveredDimensionSpacePoint   | {}                       |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    Then I expect the graph projection to consist of exactly 1 nodes


  Scenario: Removing a tethered node does not work
    Then I expect the graph projection to consist of exactly 3 nodes
    When the command RemoveNodeAggregate is executed with payload and exceptions are caught:
      | Key                          | Value            |
      | contentStreamIdentifier      | "cs-identifier"  |
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier      | "lord-tetherton" |
      | nodeVariantSelectionStrategy | "allVariants"    |
      | coveredDimensionSpacePoint   | {}               |
    Then the last command should have thrown an exception of type "TetheredNodeAggregateCannotBeRemoved"
