Feature: Creation of nodes underneath hidden nodes

  If we create new nodes underneath of hidden nodes, they must be marked as "hidden" as well; i.e. they
  must have the proper restriction edges as well.

  Background:
    Given I have no content dimensions
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    Neos.ContentRepository:Root: {}
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Content':
      properties:
        text:
          type: string
    """
    And the event RootWorkspaceWasCreated was published with payload:
      | Key                            | Value                                  |
      | workspaceName                  | "live"                                 |
      | workspaceTitle                 | "Live"                                 |
      | workspaceDescription           | "The live workspace"                   |
      | initiatingUserIdentifier       | "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" |
      | currentContentStreamIdentifier | "cs-identifier"                        |
    And the event RootNodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated was published with payload:
      | Key                           | Value                                  |
      | contentStreamIdentifier       | "cs-identifier"                        |
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier       | "lady-eleonode-rootford"               |

    And the event NodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated was published with payload:
      | Key                           | Value                                    |
      | contentStreamIdentifier       | "cs-identifier"                          |

    And the event NodeAggregateWasDisabled was published with payload:
      | Key                          | Value              |
      | contentStreamIdentifier      | "cs-identifier"    |
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier      | "the-great-nodini" |
      | affectedDimensionSpacePoints | [{}]               |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date

  Scenario: When a new node is created underneath a hidden node, this one should be hidden as well
    Given the event NodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated was published with payload:
      | Key                           | Value                                    |
      | contentStreamIdentifier       | "cs-identifier"                          |
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier       | "nodingers-cat"                          |
      | nodeTypeName                  | "Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Content" |
      | originDimensionSpacePoint     | {}                                       |
      | visibleInDimensionSpacePoints | [{}]                                     |
      | parentNodeAggregateIdentifier | "the-great-nodini"                       |
      | nodeName                      | "text2"                                  |
      | nodeAggregateClassification   | "regular"                                |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date

    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and Dimension Space Point {}
    Then I expect a node identified by aggregate identifier "nodingers-cat" not to exist in the subgraph
