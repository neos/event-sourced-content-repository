Feature: Single Node operations on multiple workspaces/content streams; e.g. copy on write!

  Background:
    Given I have no content dimensions
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': {}
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Content':
      properties:
        text:
          type: string
    """
    And the command CreateWorkspace is executed with payload:

  Scenario: Set property of a node

    Given the command "SetNodeProperty" is executed with payload:
      | Key                       | Value                               | Type                |
      | contentStreamIdentifier   | user-cs-identifier                  | Uuid                |
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier   | na-identifier                       | Uuid                |
      | originDimensionSpacePoint | {}                                  | DimensionSpacePoint |
      | propertyName              | text                                |                     |
      | value                     | {"value":"Changed","type":"string"} | json                |


    Then I expect exactly 2 events to be published on stream with prefix "Neos.ContentRepository:ContentStream:[user-cs-identifier]"
    And event at index 1 is of type "Neos.EventSourcedContentRepository:NodePropertyWasSet" with payload:
      | Key                       | Expected           | Type | AssertionType |
      | contentStreamIdentifier   | user-cs-identifier | Uuid |               |
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier   | na-identifier      | Uuid |               |
      | originDimensionSpacePoint | {}                 |      | json          |
      | propertyName              | text               |      |               |
      | value.value               | Changed            |      |               |

    And the graph projection is fully up to date

    When I am in the active content stream of workspace "live" and Dimension Space Point {}
    Then I expect a node "[node-identifier]" to exist in the graph projection
    And I expect the Node "[node-identifier]" to have the properties:
      | Key  | Value    |
      | text | Original |

    When I am in the active content stream of workspace "user-test" and Dimension Space Point {}
    Then I expect a node "[node-identifier]" to exist in the graph projection
    And I expect the Node "[node-identifier]" to have the properties:
      | Key  | Value   |
      | text | Changed |

    When I am in the active content stream of workspace "live" and Dimension Space Point {}
    Then I expect the path "/text1/text2" to lead to the node "[node-2-identifier]"
    When I go to the parent node of node aggregate "[na-2-identifier]"
    Then I expect the current Node to have the properties:
      | Key  | Value   |
      | text | Original |

    When I am in the active content stream of workspace "user-test" and Dimension Space Point {}
    Then I expect the path "/text1/text2" to lead to the node "[node-2-identifier]"
    When I go to the parent node of node aggregate "[na-2-identifier]"
    Then I expect the current Node to have the properties:
      | Key  | Value   |
      | text | Changed |
